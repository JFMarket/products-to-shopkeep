"Market Art Prints: ""Chalk"" 2009",Ginny Wall - All Nature Sings,10.5,5x7 Matted to 8x10,3,Estimated,"The watercolor titled ""Chalk"" was painted on location in the 2009 season.  It was inspired by our market's family friendly environment and the lovely shadows the children were casting onto their 'canvas'.  These kids were delighted with the process of their chalk art.  If you look carefully, you can see I took the liberty of amending their scribbles into the words (JOBO Farmers Market).  Look again and you may recognize these young artists.

Pork Applewood Smoked Bacon Pieces,Sentelle's Homemade Sausage Co.,4.75,1/2 lb pack,0,Exact,"Our bacon pieces are little goodies that are great for seasoning or making bits for salads. This is what is left after we slice our bacon.  A true artisan old world style slice of history.  It's naturally cured with sea salt, black pepper, and  brown  sugar, the same way our family has done for generations.  Our natural curing process uses the same tried and true methods used for hundreds of years before commercialized industrialization took over and took away the art of charcuterie.  It's a slow and labor intensive process, but the reward is the taste.  You won't find any other bacon that tastes like this because there is no other bacon made like this.  It's a lost and dying art from a different era.  Great with practically anything your heart desires or simply eaten by itself, we invite you to taste what bacon used to taste like 100 years ago.  As with all of our products there are absolutely no preservatives or chemical enhancements of any kind used in our bacon.  Apple wood is the only ingredient added during the smoking process.  This is a hand made artisan product processed from beginning to end by Jimmy and Minnie.    "

Each ""scrubby"" will look a little different as the felting process is rather 'free-style'.  Each soap inside the alpaca roving is approximately 4 oz.
